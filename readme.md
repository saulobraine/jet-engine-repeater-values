# Introduction

This is a plugin which extends the Crocoblock Jet Engine plugin for Elementor.

It integrates the Jet Engine repeater fields into the Dynamic Tags
functionality of Elementor.

It provides options for integrating all dynamic tag field types directly,
instead of using the dynamic widgets.

The Dynamic Visibility functionality supports dynamic tags, so this plugin
also adds support for controlling visibility based on a repeater value.

# Usage

Install the plugin and then you will find a new option in the list of dynamic
tags list, under the runthings.dev group.

You must be in a listing template, accessed via:

    Admin panel > Jet Engine > Listings > Select a template > Edit With Elementor

Then click the dynamic tag on any field and scroll down to:

    runthings.dev > JetEngine Repeater Field

Once selected, click the wrench icon to the left of the field, and enter the
name of the repeater field you want to bind.

You can get the name of the repeater field by going to the place you defined
it, eg:

    Admin panel > Jet Engine > Post Types > Edit > Repeater Field

The name is defined next to the label in the list of fields.
